HMMER is developed primarily on Linux and Mac OS/X systems. It is
tested on a variety of UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. It is
written in ANSI C99 conforming to POSIX standards. It is meant to be
portable to any POSIX-compliant system with an ANSI C99 compiler,
including all UNIX and Macintosh systems. A binary version is also
available for Windows systems with Cygwin installed (Cygwin is 
optional POSIX compatibility software).
